# EBRA STORE

EBRA Store is a lightweight e-commerce web application built using Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The project demonstrates modern front-end development practices and core e-commerce functionality, including product browsing, product detail views, and a persistent shopping cart.

## Overview

This project was developed to illustrate:

- use of the Next.js App Router
- type-safe development using TypeScript
- state management with the React Context API
- client-side cart persistence with localStorage
- modular and reusable UI components styled with Tailwind CSS

The application may be used as a learning resource, portfolio project, or as a foundation for further development into a full-featured e-commerce platform.
